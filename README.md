# ClockOnScreen
A transparent background clock displayed on screen

## Motivation
I like writing my code by using fullscreen and most of the time, I am focusing so much in this, that I tend to "lose" the sense of time.

I developed this clock in order to help watching my time.

## Installation
Just Windows 10 x64 tested, but it might work in most of the Windows OS.
